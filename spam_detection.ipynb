        "#### Main Ideas:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Naive Bayes is a simple classification algorithm that makes use of [Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) in making predictions\n",
        "* The algorithm takes a document $d$ as input, as well as a fixed set of classes $C = \\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_j\\}$ (assuming $j$ classes). The algorithm outputs the predicted class for that predicted document such that $\\gamma(d) = c$, in which $\\gamma$ is our classifier which takes in input $d$ and outputs $c \\in C$\n",
        "* In the case of [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis), the class can be the positive or negative class\n",
        "* Naive bayes ultimatelty relies the on a simple concept known as the [Bag of Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) representation\n",
        "* The bag of words representation does not consider the ordering of the words or the font in the document, but instead just considers the set of words and their counts (and is why the algorithm is naive)\n",

        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Math Details:\n",
        "\n",
        "For a document $d$ and a class $c \\in C$, we can use Bayes' theorem to calculate the [conditional probability](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability-events-conditional.html) of a particular class given a particular document such that:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(c|d) = \\frac{P(d|c)P(c)}{P(d)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The most likely class ('maximum a posteriori' aka MAP) that we are looking to assign a document to answers the question \"out of all classes $c \\in C$, what class maximises the probability that class given a document?\", represented formally as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$C_{MAP} = \\underset{c \\in C}{\\operatorname{argmax}} P(c|d)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Utilising Bayes' Theorem \n",
        "\n",
        "$$C_{MAP} = \\underset{c \\in C}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\frac{P(d|c)P(c)}{P(d)}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Removing the denominator as traditionally done in Bayesian classification we get:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$C_{MAP} = \\underset{c \\in C}{\\operatorname{argmax}} P(d|c)P(c)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Dropping the denominator is acceptable since the probability of a document $P(d)$ is a constant. Here, $P(d|c)$ is the likelihood and $P(c)$ is the prior. Representing the document as a whole set of features $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, we get:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$C_{MAP} = \\underset{c \\in C}{\\operatorname{argmax}} P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n |c)P(c)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dissecting these two pieces\n",
        "\n",
        "The quantity $P(c)$ answers the question of \"how often does this class occur?\" This can be done by counting the relative frequencies in a [corpus](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/natural_language_processing/natural_language_processing_linguistic_resources.htm). The first term is more complicated to compute, hence we make some simplifying assumptions. The first assumption is the **Bag of Words assumption** and assumes the position of the words in the document does not matter. The second assumption is **conditional independence** which assumes that the feature probabilities $P(x_i|c_j)$ are independent given the class $c$. Becuase we assume independence to simplify the problem (i.e. we don;t care about any dependencies between $x_1$ and $x_2$ etc.), we can now say that:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$P(x_1, x_2, .., x_n|c) = P(x_1|c) \\cdot P(x_2|c) \\cdot ... \\cdot P(x_n|c)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "For the [Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB), with these assumoptions in mind, we can now compute the best class (considering the Naive Bayes assumptions) as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$C_\\text{Naive Bayes} = \\underset{c \\in C}{\\operatorname{argmax}} P(c_j)\\displaystyle \\prod_{x \\in X}^{} P(x | c)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "in which $P(c_j)$ is the prior probability of the class. But now for every feature in the set of features, we are going to multiply the probability of that feature given the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we look specifically at text data, consider `positions = all word positions in the text document`:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$C_\\text{Naive Bayes} = \\underset{c_j \\in C}{\\operatorname{argmax}} P(c_j)\\displaystyle \\prod_{i \\in positions}^{} P(x_i | c_j)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "So we look at all the classes and for each class and ask what is the probability of the class (i.e $P(c_j)$), and then for each class, we walk through every position in the text and for each position we are going to look at the word in that position and ask what is its probability given the class we are currently looking at.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How are the parameters learned in the Multinomial Naive Bayes Model?\n",
        "\n",
        "The intuitive way to learn the parameters for the Multinomial Naive Bayes Model is to consider maximum likelihood estimates where we simply use the frequencies in the data. So if we wish to predict the prior probability of a particular document being in a class $j$ we can use:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\hat{P}(c_j) = \\frac{\\text{Number of documents in class j}}{\\text{Total number of documents}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "For the likelihood, the probability of $word_i$ given $class_j$ is given as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\hat{P}(w_i|c_j)=\\frac{count(w_i, c_j)}{\\sum_{w \\in Vocabulary}count(w, c_j)} = \\frac{\\text{The number of times word i occurs in documents of class j}}{\\text{total number of words in class j}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "# BUT\n",
        "\n",
        "Using maximum likelihood ultimately breaks down when using Multinomial Naiive Bayes. Consider we have a word in the test set but not in the training set. For the likelihood component of the equation (above), the numerator becomes 0, hence the entire quantity becomes zero. Hence when we look at the fact that $C_{MAP} = \\text{most likely class} = argmax_c \\hat{P}(c) \\prod_{i} {\\hat{P}(x_i|c)}$, if one of those likelihood terms are zero, $C_{MAP}$ becomes zero too and we will never pick that class.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "The solution is to add a [Laplace/Lidstone smoothing parameter](https://towardsdatascience.com/laplace-smoothing-in-na%C3%AFve-bayes-algorithm-9c237a8bdece#:~:text=Laplace%20smoothing%20is%20a%20smoothing%20technique%20that%20helps%20tackle%20the,the%20positive%20and%20negative%20reviews.). Scikit-learn sets this parameter $\\alpha$ to 1.0 by default (Laplace smoothing), though it is a hyperparameter that can be tuned and can take on values less than one (Lidstone smoothing). When smoothing occurs, we get modified equations of:\n",
